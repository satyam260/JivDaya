Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than Rs. 500,000 in damages, JivDaya will pay reasonable attorneys&#39; fees should you prevail. JivDaya will not seek attorneys&#39; fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than Rs. 500,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys&#39; fees will be governed by the applicable rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.<br><br><strong> Arbitration Agreement</strong> <br> JivDaya and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:<br> claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<br> claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<br> claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and<br> claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service.<br> References to &quot; JivDaya &quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;us&quot; include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and JivDaya are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.<br><br><strong> Termination</strong><br> You agree that JivDaya, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services and remove and discard any content within the Services, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if JivDaya believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Services, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. JivDaya may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that JivDaya may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Services. Further, you agree that JivDaya will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Services.<br><br><strong> User Disputes</strong><br> You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Services and JivDaya will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. JivDaya reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Services.<br><br> <strong>General</strong><br> These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and JivDaya and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and JivDaya with respect to the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of India without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and JivDaya agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and courts located within Valsad, Gujarat. The failure of JivDaya to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of JivDaya, but JivDaya may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.
